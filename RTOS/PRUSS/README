Hardware Solutions for Real-Time Operation in Embedded Systems
Case study: the Texas Instruments PRU-ICSS on the Sitara AM335x Embedded System On Chip (SoC)

The AM335x features two on-chip programmable real-time units (PRUs) which are themselves 32-bit RISC cores operating at 200 MHz
Because real-time operation is often critical in embedded systems applications,getting into the PRU subsystem (PRUSS) is important for developers who like the potential of Linux but need a hard-real-time solution. 
This project covers the full range of a PRU application, from electronics to software
The aim here is to get the enhanced GPIOs working using the “remoteproc” approach provided. 
The PRU assembly language code is compiled and program the PRU-ICSS via Linux tools.
