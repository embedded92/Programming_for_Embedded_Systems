Game of Life program here is demonstrated for four communities(one down and four across), where the size of each community is 32x16(rows=32, col=16) in size. 
These 4 communities make an environment where cells being the smallest unit in the system.

There are four Threads in this system, each one is updating a community. 
During the process of  thread creation by pthread_create function , updateCommFunn function is passed as a function pointer to this thread.

In this program  we are asking the user to enter values for community, 1 representing live cell and 0 representing dead cell. 
Then we copy these same values to the other communities as well. This is done as part of the “initEnvironment()” function. 
After initializing the environment with the respective values. We create multiple threads one for each community, and each thread has the responsibility of updating one community.
