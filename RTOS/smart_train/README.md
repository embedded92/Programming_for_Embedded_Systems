Project Title: IoT based Automatic Railway Gate Controller

This project is about automatically controlling the Railway gates for incomming road traffic at arrival and departure of the Train and sending a message over cloud about timing and date at which train arrives at the gate. The railway gates are closed when the ultrasonic sensor detects the arrival of the train. On the other hand, the gates will be open when the second ultrasonic sensor detects the departure of the train. BeagleBone Black works as master device which is 32-bit microprocessor with high processing speed.  The following interface devices are used in project:
•	Use of ESP8266 module which has Wi-Fi usingIEEE802.11 protocol to provide WiFi access to the Beaglebone black.
•	Use of LCD to display messages in case of Emergency and status of the train.
•	Use of DC motor interfaced with DC motor driver circuit L293D for closing and opening of gates.
•	Use of the Ultrasonic sensors to detect train on the railway track for closing and opening of gates.
•	Use of Panic Button that will be pressed in an emergency situation.
•	Use of Buzzer to alert the users about upcoming trains and closure of gates.
•	Use of IoT through Wi-Fi for cloud storage, such as,ThingSpeak.
